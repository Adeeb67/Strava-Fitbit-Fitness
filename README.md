# Strava-Fitbit-Fitness
Analyze daily, hourly, and minute-level Fitbit data to explore steps, calories burned, sleep patterns, and weight trends. Visualizations and correlations reveal insights into activity habits and overall health.
#Project Summary

For this project, I explored 8 Fitbit/Strava datasets that track activity, calories, sleep, and weight. Instead of trying to use every file available, I focused only on the ones that gave meaningful insights about daily habits and health patterns.

#Data Used

dailyActivity_merged.csv → overall daily stats (steps, calories, distance, active minutes)

dailyCalories_merged.csv → calories burned per day

dailySteps_merged.csv → daily step counts

sleepDay_merged.csv → total minutes asleep and time in bed

weightLogInfo_merged.csv → logged weight information

hourlySteps_merged.csv → steps recorded each hour

hourlyCalories_merged.csv → calories burned each hour

minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv → fine-grained minute-by-minute step data

#What I Analyzed

Daily trends → visualized steps, calories, and sleep over time.

Hourly patterns → identified which times of day had the most steps and calorie burn.

Minute-level activity → spotted bursts of movement in the minute-by-minute step data.

Sleep analysis → compared minutes asleep vs total time in bed.

Weight logs → explored weight entries to connect activity with body metrics.

Combined dashboard → pulled together steps, calories, and sleep into one visualization.

Correlation heatmap → studied relationships between activity, calories, and sleep.

#Key Takeaways

Steps and calories are strongly linked — higher step counts almost always mean more calories burned.

Activity varies by time of day — certain hours consistently show peaks in steps and calorie burn.

Sleep quality isn’t just about time in bed — actual minutes asleep can be noticeably lower.

Weight logs provide context but are less frequent compared to steps or calories.

#Conclusion

By analyzing just 8 core CSV files, I was able to build a clear picture of my daily activity, energy use, and sleep habits. The project shows how a mix of daily, hourly, and minute-level data can be combined to create meaningful insights. Even without using all 18 files, this smaller set was more than enough to create a complete and balanced analysis.
